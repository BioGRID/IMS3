* RPM
This is made to be run as an RPM.  While it is possable to put these
files in a correctly configrued web server it is very likely that
password could get leaked.  So bulid the RPM and run from CentOS
unless you are developing.

** make rpm
Should make an RPM suitable for CentOS 6.3 anyway.  Read the
README and install the RPM.

** make rpms
Also makes a python RPM, only suitable if you have an older version of
IMS running and you need to port the database over.

* Developement
Get latest source from:
    https://github.com/svenmh/IMS3

I have a symbolic like from my ~/public_html/xxx directory to the
./www directory, and provided php in configured to work there all
should be well.

The latest code will often be out of sync with the RPM *.spec
file. Feal free to gripe about that.

** ./ims.json
If you don't create an ./ims.json file it will find an /etc/ims.json
file.  Follow the steps in the README to create the /etc/ims.json file
to create the ./ims.json file.


* Database
For now, I'm only concerned about porting IMS2->IMS3.  Use the
python-BioGRID-IMS RPM for that.
