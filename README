* Introduction
Source Code for future versions of BioGRID IMS, see:
       http://wiki.thebiogrid.org/doku.php/interaction_management_system
For now mainly concerned in porting the IMS2 database schema to the
IMS3 schema.

* Non RPM requires
Currently jQUery, bootstrap, and select2 are required but not included
in the RPM and not available from default CentOS RPMs.  You will need
to specify where they are using the /etc/ims.json file.

* /etc/ims.json
The main configuration file.  It can also be located ../ims.json
relative to the location if the ims.php file, but that is mainly for
developement.

Note, no comments are allowed in JSON files.
